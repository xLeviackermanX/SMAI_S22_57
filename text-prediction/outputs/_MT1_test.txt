When I was in my 20s, I saw my very first psychotherapy client.

I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.

She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.

Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.

My classmate got an arsonist for her first client.

And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.

This I thought I could handle.

But I didn't handle it.

With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session, it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road.
     0.0
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say, and as far as I could tell, she was right.
     0.0
Work happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later, even death happened later.

Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.

But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
     0.27487035324611075
I pushed back.
     0.0
I said, "Sure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a knucklehead, but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."
     0.0
And then my supervisor said, "Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
     0.39548670767829525
Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one."
     0.0
That's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.
     0.0
That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
     0.0
Yes, people settle down later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.
     0.0
That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot, and we were sitting there blowing it.

There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.

We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.

This is not my opinion. These are the facts.
     0.0
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35.
     0.3139668110273748
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s.

So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options.
     0.1842156300895617
So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain.
     0.0
It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become.
     0.26147964747715874
But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development, and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.

So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say, "You have 10 extra years to start your life"?

Nothing happens.

When a lot has been pushed to your 30s, there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.

Many of these things are incompatible, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.

I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.
     0.0
Here's a story about how that can go.
     0.0
It's a story about a woman named Emma.
     0.21513767548106738
At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
     0.0
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
     0.0
Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition.
     0.0
And as hard as her 20s were, her early life had been even harder.
     0.0
She often cried in our sessions, but then would collect herself by saying, "You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
     0.0
Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap, and she sobbed for most of the hour.
     0.0
She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said, "Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?
     0.0
Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"
     0.0
Now in that moment, it took everything I had not to say, "I will."
     0.29864662870579234
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.
     0.0
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
     0.0
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by.
     0.0
So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every twentysomething, male or female, deserves to hear.
     0.0
First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital.
     0.0
By get identity capital, I mean do something that adds value to who you are.
     0.0
Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next.
     0.0
I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Identity capital begets identity capital.
     0.0
So now is the time for that cross-country job, that internship, that startup you want to try.
     0.0
I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here, but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count, which, by the way, is not exploration.
     0.0
That's procrastination.
     0.24453811042938958
I told Emma to explore work and make it count.
     0.0
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.
     0.0
That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle.
     0.0
New things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends.
     0.0
So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.
     0.0
But half aren't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
     0.0
Half of new jobs are never posted, so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that un-posted job.
     0.0
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.
     0.0
Last but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
     0.0
Now this was true for her growing up, but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.
     0.0
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
     0.0
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you.
     0.0
But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress.
     0.3480334449338984
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work.
     0.0
Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you.
     0.0
So what happened to Emma?
     0.0
Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state.
     0.3601812344590805
That weak tie helped her get a job there.
     0.0
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.
     0.0
Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.
     0.0
She's married to a man she mindfully chose.
     0.0
She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, "Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough."
     0.0
Now Emma's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.
     0.0
They are so easy to help.
     0.0
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX, bound for somewhere west.

Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.

Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29, one good conversation, one good break, one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come.
     0.0
So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know.
     0.23132405688672183
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
     0.0
Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do.

You're deciding your life right now.

Throughout the history of computers we've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild.
     0.0
And this gap has become shorter, shorter, and even shorter, and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter, the thickness of a touch-screen glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
     0.0
But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
     0.0
I started to imagine what this would look like.
     0.0
First, I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space, so when you press it hard on the screen, it transfers its physical body into pixels.
     0.0
Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen.
     0.22439183829637702
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
     0.38082567773214376
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.
     0.0
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands?
     0.0
At Microsoft Applied Sciences, along with my mentor Cati Boulanger, I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace.
     0.22692441193134333
Because windows and files have a position in the real space, selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
     0.0
Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines, words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
     0.0
Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly.
     0.0
So in these examples, we are reaching into the digital world.
     0.0
But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead?
     0.0
I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online.
     0.0
But now you don't have to worry about it.
     0.0
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
     0.0
This is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body.
     0.0
Taking this idea further, I started to think, instead of just seeing these pixels in our space, how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it?
     0.0
What would such a future look like?
     0.0
At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post, we created this one physical pixel.
     0.0
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet acts like a 3D pixel in our space, which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space.
     0.0
What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies.
     0.0
And by digitally programming the object, we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space, which means that now, human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world.
     0.0
So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality.
     0.0
And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities.
     0.0
As you can see, the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world.
     0.0
Today, we started by talking about the boundary, but if we remove this boundary, the only boundary left is our imagination.

Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
     0.0
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation?
     0.0
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous.
     0.0
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
     0.2541558477876202
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible.

As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right?

Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood.

Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes.

It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion.

Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented.

It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.

I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier.
     0.3270164442663309
And I had this notion that I might enter it, sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.
     0.0
It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.

These are just tricks.
     0.0
They are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work.
     0.303667175559765
And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.

We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift, but that is not the case.

When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.
     0.0
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools.
     0.3632230810168569
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.
     0.0
I gave out homework assignments.
     0.0
When the work came back, I calculated grades.
     0.0
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
     0.20593241892539754
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric I.Q. scores.
     0.0
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
     0.2689646596220039
And that got me thinking.
     0.0
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.
     0.34931826744075667
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.
     0.23371824844382422
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is I.Q., but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily?
     0.34817034070597236
So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.
     0.0
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
     0.23386289652773753
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.
     0.0
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out.
     0.0
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.
     0.0
We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?
     0.34354870909175445
And who's going to earn the most money?
     0.0
In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.
     0.0
And it wasn't social intelligence.
     0.32561734019656546
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't I.Q.
     0.39337172570343765
It was grit.
     0.0
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
     0.0
Grit is having stamina.
     0.0
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
     0.0
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.
     0.0
A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.
     0.0
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate.
     0.31737818652587785
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
     0.0
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it.
     0.2624669763658797
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build grit in kids?
     0.0
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?
     0.18264713447856082
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"
     0.0
The honest answer is, I don't know.
     0.0
What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.
     0.0
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments.
     0.0
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.
     0.0
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset."
     0.0
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.
     0.3629824246086967
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.
     0.28682917511031947
But we need more.
     0.0
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are.
     0.30765935784297094
That's the work that stands before us.
     0.24391166911940962
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them.
     0.0
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned.
     0.0
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.

My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions.
     0.0
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
     0.0
Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
     0.334713235831569
And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
     0.2830379104904861
The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
     0.0
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design.
     0.0
At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away.
     0.3658116172882018
After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points.
     0.36121917896970723
First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things.
     0.0
Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling.
     0.0
In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
     0.22030259503877106
And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
     0.0
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
     0.0
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity.
     0.47093845166227405
So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.
     0.20793106690321198
But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles.
     0.0
The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there.
     0.0
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
     0.0
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building.
     0.0
And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain.
     0.0
And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
     0.0
I also thought, how to close the building?
     0.0
And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions.
     0.0
And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way.
     0.0
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
     0.0
That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade.
     0.0
And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building.
     0.0
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.
     0.0
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, "This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."
     0.45863484227230944
But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell.
     0.20835448972557136
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
     0.38548207057708544
So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project.
     0.22246328181823444
And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
     0.0
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
     0.0
And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
     0.1900017247660614
And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
     0.0
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
     0.2554277375829644
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
     0.2128494964498075
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
     0.0
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
     0.19161818729600966
On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern.
     0.0
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
     0.3121752161839901
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
     0.33970817072567094
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation.
     0.0
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
     0.0
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
     0.0
It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians.
     0.0
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
     0.19599345807838425
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
     0.0
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
     0.39481769013887286
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.
     0.2491301938091871
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
     0.0
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing.
     0.0
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
     0.0
Thank you very much.

So I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust.
     0.0
I think these are so commonplace, they've become clichés of our society.
     0.0
And I think there are three.
     0.2555432943517148
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust, very widely believed.
     0.0
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.
     0.0
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
     0.0
I think that the claim, the aim and the task are all misconceived.
     0.0
So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
     0.24351931544898087
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
     0.0
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
     0.24048377593584824
I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others.
     0.0
I don't have an overview.
     0.18825556865495768
But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls, and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined.
     0.0
When you actually look at opinion polls across time, there's not much evidence for that.
     0.0
That's to say, the people who were mistrusted 20 years ago, principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
     0.3505320554606452
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
     0.0
The rest of us are in between, and by the way, the average person in the street is almost exactly midway.
     0.0
But is that good evidence?
     0.0
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
     0.0
What else can they record?
     0.40537704183537365
So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions.
     0.36422195126907936
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
     0.27318118208415787
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
     0.0
Do you trust fishmongers?
     0.0
Do you trust elementary school teachers?"
     0.0
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
     0.0
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.
     0.0
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that, "Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
     0.36316211798037423
That's a perfectly rational thing.
     0.0
In short, in our real lives, we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
     0.0
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform.
     0.0
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read, but in no way to drive the school minibus.
     0.3749116176002134
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
     0.3442126114331257
I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.
     0.0
Simple.
     0.0
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated, why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly?
     0.0
I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists, because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust.
     0.0
Secondly, what about the aim?
     0.34434606600328077
The aim is to have more trust.
     0.0
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
     0.0
It's not what I would aim at.
     0.0
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy.
     0.0
In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
     0.0
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
     0.0
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim.
     0.0
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness.
     0.0
It's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects.
     0.0
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
     0.24435204891836726
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
     0.0
And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters, and reliable and honest, we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them, because they'll be trustworthy.
     0.0
But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
     0.0
I have friends who are competent and honest, but I would not trust them to post a letter, because they're forgetful.
     0.0
I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things, but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
     0.0
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
     0.0
If so, I haven't yet spotted it.
     0.0
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before trust.
     0.0
Trust is the response.
     0.0
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge. And, of course, it's difficult.
     0.0
Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
     0.0
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.
     0.34054922237827484
They don't work as they're supposed to.
     0.2799423724941818
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
     0.2351051285706829
And all over our public life, our institutional life, we find that problem, that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite.
     0.0
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks, like midwives, from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
     0.21482322836767143
You can all give your own examples there.
     0.0
So so much for the aim.
     0.0
It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction, attitudes, don't do adequately here.
     0.1884416734943366
Now thirdly, the task.
     0.3614489621906416
Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think, also gets things backwards.
     0.25093430260413113
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
     0.3753454584166497
Well, we can do that for ourselves.
     0.0
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
     0.0
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
     0.3833100777508242
But trust, in the end, is distinctive because it's given by other people.
     0.22382344441896293
You can't rebuild what other people give you.
     0.24599071529870767
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust.
     0.3743793040775507
So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
     0.0
And that, of course, is because you can't fool all of the people all of the time, usually.
     0.0
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy.
     0.0
How to do it?
     0.2598475904385484
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions, quite effectively.
     0.0
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
     0.29749392799453145
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any questions.
     0.0
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
     0.0
That's super. I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
     0.0
I think there's a big lesson in that.
     0.39263771987203894
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party, then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying.
     0.0
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern.
     0.39010805245333247
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy.
     0.28844892423576046

I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.
     0.0
It totally dominated her imagination for months.
     0.4111545438256865
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
     0.45009022617532624
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand.
     0.27805055504490134
But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is.

Now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
     0.25465542540126707
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
     0.0
It did not start that trend.
     0.0
Do you know what I'm talking about?
     0.38792141362404103
Yeah.
     0.2171087981001617
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz" and all the movies we watch today.
     0.0
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."
     0.0
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
     0.0
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today, the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold.
     0.0
Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."
     0.0
But that's not how it happens.
     0.0
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz" to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female.
     0.28381306167813636
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter, which was years later, and the situation was different.
     0.0
At that point I also had a son.
     0.0
He was only three at the time.
     0.0
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
     0.0
But he was the second child, and the level of supervision had plummeted.
     0.0
So he wandered in, and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling, and I don't think he understands what's going on, but he is sure soaking in it.
     0.0
And I wonder what he's soaking in.
     0.0
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty?
     0.4402848876406496
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government?
     0.0
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."
     0.0
How does Dorothy win her movie?
     0.0
By making friends with everybody and being a leader.
     0.0
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in -- Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting, which is where we kind of have to be.
     0.0
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force -- in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow brick road?

There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls, and you should do that reading. It's very good.

I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed.

I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right?

I finished my quest, I got the girl.
     0.0
Why are you still standing there?
     0.0
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
     0.0
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys.

It's almost as though if you're a boy, you are a dopey animal, and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.

There are plenty of exceptions, and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
     0.0
But they do send a message to boys, that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.

They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy, but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.

There's no models for them.

Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, when they finally came out with "Brave."
     0.36179248015415677
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.

Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?

"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."

I don't know if you've heard of this.

Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist, and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
     0.0
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask: Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines?
     0.39180852492921264
So try to meet that bar.
     0.0
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
     0.508173082975769
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like?

Thank you very much.

It does happen. I've seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love.

In fact, this week I went to see a very high-quality movie, "Argo."

Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.

It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.

So let's look at the numbers.
     0.3905244531469557
2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
     0.2071656516413349
Eleven. It's not bad.
     0.0
It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.

But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down.

Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.

I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid.
     0.0
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.
     0.3534388716951982
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.

His village is near Mogadishu.

Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation.

One beautiful day in Mogadishu, under an azure blue sky, a car bomb goes off.
     0.0
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda.
     0.0
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up?
     0.23475754370131388
He was waiting.
     0.0
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along.
     0.0
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood.
     0.0
And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world.
     0.0
It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg, sparks riots in London, who reaches out for something other than waithood.
     0.0
For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.

They sought people like him out.

But his story takes a different route.
     0.0
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads.

Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.

He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.

How is this story different?
     0.27522018174629553
What makes his story different?
     0.0
I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity.
     0.0
It's entrepreneurship, and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood.
     0.1837502048510264
It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking.

I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
     0.3433711997181917
He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
     0.0
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?" for many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, "Never."
     0.28659105813455116
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
     0.0
He started a landscaping and design floral company.
     0.0
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate.
     0.0
There's no public park in Mogadishu.
     0.0
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
     0.2184088711382551
And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water, by the way.
     0.0
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
     0.0
They had never really thought about starting up a business.
     0.0
They've thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
     0.0
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
     0.0
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers.
     0.0
By the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
     0.0
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.
     0.22570309273246245
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality.
     0.0
They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
     0.23494382047745602
Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
     0.0
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business.
     0.0
It's about creating a social impact.
     0.3119492166403095
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
     0.0
I believe he is selling hope.
     0.2947432568699546
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city.
     0.0
Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him.
     0.0
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood.
     0.0
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
     0.0
So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood.

What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years.
     0.31759512492167746
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago.
     0.0
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
     0.37315230617275286
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood plane.
